- I fall asleep as I stare at this screen.
- I fall deep into the most surreal dream.

- The world is so dark.
- The world is so cold.
- There's 7 billion people.
- Each a story they hold.
- I stare into their eyes,
- look away from the screen.
- I see myself, in the most surreal dream.
- A simple solution, to the most pressing problems.
- To see myself, is how I solve them.

- But there are problems on a much smaller scale
- I'm afraid to act.
- I'm afraid to fail.
- I look at a mirror and stare into his eyes.
- Who is this man, this man in disguise?
- I look a little deeper and away from the screen,
- I see myself, in the most surreal dream.
- A simple solution, to all of my problems.
- To see myself, is how I solve them.

- But what about life?
- So scary, so vast,
- Is there a God?
- How long will I last?
- I lay in the grass and stare at the sky,
- look into the stars, straight into God's eye
- A much larger world, outside of our own
- Our world is so small, yet it's all we've known.
- To fully understand, I peer deep into the scene,
- I see myself, in the most surreal dream.
- A simple solution to unknown problems.
- To see myself, is how I solve them.

- Will I see myself when I awake to this screen?
- Can I see myself outside the most surreal dream?
