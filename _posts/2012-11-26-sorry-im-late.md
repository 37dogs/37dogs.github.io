- I'm sorry
- that I'm late to work
- but there was a bird talking
- he was speaking soft and sweetly
- yet nobody was listening

- I had to stop and
- hear him out
- hear his beautiful song
- he told me secrets
- of the bird variety

- he told me to be strong
- he told me not to worry
- and that it would all be okay
- he told me he was happy
- despite this dreary day

- I told him that his song was sweet
- and that I envied his wings
- he looked at me, perched on that tree
- and said I was no more grounded than he
- he said I didn't need any wings
- he said I was beautiful
- he told me to fly
- he urged me to fly
- he claimed I knew how
- and then he asked why
- he asked why I hadn't
- he asked why I wasn't
- he asked why I envied
- him when I could do
- everything and more
- see everything and more
- be everything and more

- it's amazing what you
- can learn if you
- simply stop and listen
- a bird speaks a beautiful song
- and no one pays attention

- so that's why I'm late to work
- I really hope you don't mind
- also here's my two weeks notice
- I'm leaving this life behind.
