My life's messed up,
But I know why.
I have no wings
Yet I want to fly

You spread your arms
And catch me there
I have no wings
Yet I'm not scared

I take a leap
A leap of faith
Don't catch me now
I will escape

Don't hold me down
I'm gonna fly
Don't ask me questions
I know not why

Without direction
I take my steps
An open mind
Is all that's left

I'm vulnerable
I'm naked now
Asking questions
To answer how

Questions come
But the answers don't
Pursuit of answers
Bring me hope

Answers are fake but
the journey is real
Its amazing how beauty
Makes one feel.

I'm feeling good now
I'm feeling high
Cut the strings
I don't need wings to fly.
