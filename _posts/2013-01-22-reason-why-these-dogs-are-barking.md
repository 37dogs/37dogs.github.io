- Cold now but warmer still
- The dogs won't quit barking
- There's got to be a reason why this match isn't sparking
- There's got to be a reason why these dogs are barking.

- We take our steps or maybe two
- The world is completely full of fluff
- Yet the fluff can't begin to muffle the barking
- There's got to be a reason why these dogs are barking.

- And open portal, I walk right through
- There's an old man who looks like he's seen the world
- He tries to speak, but nothing comes out
- There's got to be a reason why these dogs are barking.

- The morning news
- There's nothing good
- The words are blurry and don't say much
- There's got to be a reason why these dogs are barking

- I made it to class on time
- I sat in my seat, eager for the lecture to start
- I'm alone in the lecture hall and class never starts
- There's got to be a reason why these dogs are barking

- The zoo animals came to me
- It wasn't a dream but it wasn't reality
- There's not a whole lot that I understand
- There's got to be a reason why these dogs are barking

- Maybe I'm asking too many questions
- Maybe I'm trying to find answers that don't exist
- Maybe there man and the zoo and the sparks and the class are simpler
- Maybe there isn't a reason why these dogs are barking
