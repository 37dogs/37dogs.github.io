[Albert Camus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Camus) was an existentialist philosopher of the mid 1900s whose views and contributions gave rise to the existentialist concept known as [absurdism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism).

Because Albert Camus didn't believe in any objective meaning to life, he saw that there were three options to living your life:

>
1. Commit suicide.
2. Commit philosophical suicide (let religion, national pride, sports teams, etc. give you meaning).
3. Give yourself meaning.

In Camus' Myth of Sisyphus he describes these three options in detail and suggests that the third is the best option. To give yourself meaning is to accept the absurd, accept that there is no objective meaning to our existence and to continue to live despite this. To give yourself meaning is to find something that gives you joy and provokes some sort of positive emotional response, something to put your entire being into, something to look forward to. There may not be a meaning to life, but we can still create a meaning.

Of course after reading about Camus, I can't help but think that creating our own meaning to life is similarly pointless, but maybe that's just because I'm at a point in my life right now where I'm trying to decide what I want to give meaning to. Nevertheless, I find Absurdism to be a very interesting philosophical concept and one that I resonate with. It's hard to accept that there is no objective meaning to life, but once you can accept that, there is an enormous amount of freedom that opens up to you. If there is no objective meaning to life, we can stop searching for meaning. If there is no objective meaning to life, we can stop trying to be something we aren't. If there is no objective meaning to life, we are completely and totally free to create our own meaning and live by whatever rules we impose upon ourselves.
