- bottle of wine with you
- getting friendly
- getting tipsy
- feel the fire with you
- stumble towards
- the cold beach sand
- we fill the
- wine bottle
- with that white
- Bermuda sand
- here's a memory
- of us with the sand
- between our toes
- the gentle tides
- teasing our calves
- our warm embrace
- lighting the flames
- in our heart
- a memory of the night
- we fell in love
- when every kiss felt
- like the first
- when we wrestled silently
- on a creaky beach chair
- and our bodies moved
- in tune with the tide
- tipsy, thrusting, it felt
- too surreal
- I had been numb, but
- you made me feel
- and we capped
- the bottle
- and ran to the house
- and we collapsed into
- each other's arms
- oh the memories that night,
- the night we fell in love
- I coulda died that night
- and should of died perhaps
- but together we'll move on
- and we're getting through this life
- and forever we'll have this bottle
- to remind of the fire
- to remind of how pure the love
- to help us through the hard times
- to remind us
- we're in love.
