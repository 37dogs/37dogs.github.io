- Two ex lovers meet eyes
- and there's a hollowness
- but there's a familiarity that
- stimulates the mind and body
- and locking eyes for 30 seconds
- turns into a deep kiss that
- reminds them of something, but
- there's still a hollowness


- The lovers' lips meet perfectly
- there are no awkward movements
- the kiss is objectively amazing
- an action practiced over years

- hands slowly undress the other
- familiar actions, comfortable
- naked bodies fill space
- in noticeably different ways, and
- the differences become discoveries
- among rehearsed actions
- and rehearsed feelings

- they hold each other tightly
- hearts beat in sync and
- soft pleasurable kisses lead
- to passionate sweaty grasps
- at what they used to be together

- their sex is objectively beautiful
- and similarly objectively amazing
- an action practiced over years
- a fail safe climax with an old friend.
- but still, there's a hollowness.
