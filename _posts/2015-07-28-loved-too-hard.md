- I think about love and it makes my chest feel tight.
- I'm grasping for breaths and my heart is beating faster.
- My limbs start to feel shaky with nervousness.


- I picture two people together and my eyes start to water.
- I'm not going to cry, but I do feel sadness.
- I won't count that single tear.


- And with watery eyes and anxiety tearing through my body from the inside out, I sigh.
- I feel like I've loved too hard to ever love again.
- My heart feels full of empty emotion.
- And yet I lust for attention.
- I want to feel the touch of a woman.
- I want to lie next to her warm body and feel secure.
- I want to feel sadness and then tender lips and exhale and I want it to be OK.


- But, it isn't.
- I'm not sure if it will be.
- I've loved too hard to ever love again.
- Maybe I'm being too sensitive, but
- I don't think I can be anything but.


- I think about love and I swear tears would fall
- if anxiety, if fear, if sadness
- hadn't sucked me dry
- of anything and everything I had left to give.


- I've loved too hard to ever love again.
- I've loved too hard and now I just hurt.
