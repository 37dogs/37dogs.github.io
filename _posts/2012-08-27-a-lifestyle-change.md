I've changed quite a bit this summer. Living alone allowed me to reflect on myself, who I was, and who I wanted to become. Having an entire summer with zero distractions really helps a person get to know themselves. Coming out of this summer, I've learned how to live a much happier life and I believe that my "formula" for happiness is general enough that anyone can implement it in their own life. The following is some insight into that "formula".

When you're a kid, you don't care what other people think. You wear ugly ass t-shirts and run around shouting embarrassing nonsense. When you're a kid, you live worry free. You have no idea what you're going to eat tomorrow, but you don't even care. When you're a kid, happiness is easy.

However, there comes a turning point in a kid's life where all of the sudden things aren't so easy. Other kids in school start to make fun of the fact that you still wear a Barney t-shirt in 1st grade. You start to worry about pleasing others. Your parents and teachers tell you that realistically you can't be an astronaut. Happiness in life gets harder as living life "correctly" gets more complex.

Usually, this kind of thought process carries on throughout a person's life and sometimes never leaves them. People live their entire lives trying to live life "correctly" and wishing that they could live as happily and simply as they did in their childhood.

**Why?**

If you could be this happy as a kid, why can't you live a similar lifestyle and be happy today? The best part is that kids seem to only live by three simple rules.

No shame: It doesn't matter what anyone else thinks. Do what you feel is right for you.
No worries: Do your best at what you want to do and the blanks will fill themselves in.
No limits: You can be that astronaut you always wanted to be.
This summer, I've been working on implementing these rules into my own life and it's not easy. However, I can truly believe that these three rules are key to happiness. Let me give some examples of how I've tried to implement these rules into my life.

1. **No Shame**

If you don't care what people think, you can do those things that you always wanted to do but were too afraid of what your friends would think. From this summer, I would like to add the following to that list:

- Meeting with random people from the internet and blogging about it.
- Blogging about my personal thoughts and beliefs.
- Writing my own website.
- Couch Surfing

All of these are things that I wanted to do and things that I feel ultimately made/make my life more enjoyable. Still, I have a filter. Not being afraid of judgement is extremely hard and it's something that I'm certainly still actively working towards because it's so much more fun to not care!

2. **No Worries**

People ask me all the time what my career plans are. This is something that used to bother my furiously. It's hard to find something that I know I would be comfortable doing for the rest of my life, but I've always thought that I had to figure it out now. This summer, I've completed changed that mindset. I've realized that [it's okay to be unsure](/fortune-cookies). I've decided that I'm just going to do whatever feels right until I know for sure that I am doing exactly what I want to do. When I go back to school in the spring, I plan on steering clear of the engineering classes that I should (based on current major graduation requirements) be taking and taking some classes in areas where my interest more strongly pulses like business or photography because why the hell not?

This is a choice that is already making me happier. Where I was previously dreading school, I'm actually getting excited about taking classes where I might actually learn something interesting and applicable to my life.

3. **No Limits**

This isn't necessarily new to me. I've never really been a fan of the limits that society/education puts on people. "You can't do X if Y." It's annoying and degrading. If your teacher tells you that you wouldn't be a good writer, why would you even want to try anymore? I know that anyone can do anything if they want to. That sounds incredibly cliche, but it really is true. If you want it, grab it. It make take a while to develop the correct applicable skill set, but if you want it, you can take that time and push yourself into success.

In my personal life, the biggest example I have of this is getting two internships my freshman year. Ohio State doesn't let freshman into their Engineering Career Services program because freshman aren't supposed to get internships. I used this as motivation instead of an end to my quest. I went to the career fair and because I really desired to take a break from school and experience the working force and I was able to transfer the feelings of that drive and desire into the recruiters enough to get interviews. As a freshman, I was extremely proud of this accomplishment. Class didn't matter. I wanted it more than anyone else, I showed my drive and desire to learn and succeed, and it worked.

There are no limits. If you want it, grab it. The hardest part is disregarding any person that ever told you it wasn't possible. It is possible.

I know for a fact that I wanted to say a lot more on this subject, but I can't remember any of it. And with that I say,

Live like a kid: No shame. No Worries. No Limits.
