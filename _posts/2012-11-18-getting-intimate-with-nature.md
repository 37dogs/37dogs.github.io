- do you think
- if I strip naked here
- I can get intimate with
- nature

- is it as simple
- as stripping naked here,
- getting intimate
- with nature

- I just want to feel
- what the trees feel
- and I want to
- show them my love

- I want to sing
- like the birds sing
- and then soar
- up above

- I want to get lost
- in peace of mind
- and the silence
- of these woods

- I want to stand here
- vulnerable and naked
- and embrace
- everything that's good

- I want to take a seat
- and meditate
- and feel the pure
- connectedness

- do you think
- if I strip naked here
- I can get intimate with
- nature

- is it that simple?
