- I asked the homeless man
- for a drag of his last cigarette
- the only thing the man
- had to his name
- he passed to me
- despite the fact
- that I was only going to
- help it disappear
- I'm not sure why I asked this man
- to share what little he had left
- especially since I don't even smoke

- perhaps it was a plea for help
- I needed someone to talk to
- he didn't talk much but
- no one talked to him much
- so he didn't know what to say
- it didn't matter really though
- because my lips left my secrets
- on the mouth of that cigarette
- and though he said nothing
- He nodded gently as I walked away
- and he knew
- he had to know and
- that was all I needed
