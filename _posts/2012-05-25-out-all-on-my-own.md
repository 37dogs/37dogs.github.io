It's official. I have a place to live for this summer. Today I signed the final papers on the lease and I move in on June 10th.

This is extremely exciting, but also kind of bittersweet. I've always been a pretty independent guy, but this is it. I'll be almost 100% on my own. Pay my own bills, cook my own meals, clean my own place... It's exciting because I'm now more my own responsibility than anyone else's. I love the independence associated with having your own place. But it's sad because I'm moving away from home. I'll really miss my family. They are crazy and hectic and sometimes I need a break from them, but in the end I love them and I'm definitely going to miss spending the summer with them.

This will be the first summer ever that I haven't lived at home. And it's scary to admit that there's a good chance that I will never live at home again. This temporary moving out may in fact be a foreshadowing of me permanently moving out. I'm growing up and it's a whole mess of emotions to admit that. I still feel like a kid. But, I realize now that adults are just as lost in the world as kids are and growing up only answers <em>some</em> of the questions. Adults are just regular, flawed people but it's still crazy to realize that I'm becoming one.

Moving out on your own also packs a heavy burden. You don't realize how much you took your parents for granted until you have to live on your own. Looking at potential grocery, rent, utilities, and internet expenses is almost overwhelming and I'm only looking at the prices for one person! I couldn't imagine the financial stress of having to provide for a family of seven! I really appreciate now more than ever all that my mother has done for me in this aspect. She ALWAYS found a way to make sure I had everything I needed. I also really appreciate how much she has prepared me for the real world. She is without a doubt, my biggest social role model.  Two of my mother's life lessons that have had a significant effect on morphing me into who I am today are 1. "Do whatever you want, but understand the possible consequences you'll have to deal with if you choose certain things. Making mistakes and learning from them is important." and 2. "It's all about who you know. If you can talk the talk, you can wiggle your way into anything.". Honestly, moving out of the house this early in life would seem unfathomable if not for my mother's incredible parenting. These two philosophies have gotten me to where I am today. Thanks Mom!
