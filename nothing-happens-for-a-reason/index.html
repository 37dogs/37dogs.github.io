	<h2>Nothing Happens for a Reason</h2>

		<p>“Everything happens for a reason” is a powerful mantra to live by. It’s typically one of the first quotes that people remember and it’s a quote that parents and friends pull out to help console you in a time of depression. This saying has gained immense popularity when dealing with break-ups, especially among the teenage girls (Think post-breakup Facebook statuses), but it is also popular when dealing with getting fired, not landing a job, or not winning a game. In general, this saying brings comfort to those who experience an unfair or unusual experience in life. But, is it true that everything happens for a reason? Behind this question is an interesting philosophical debate and I’m going to give my personal opinion on the matter.</p>

<p>I think that there are a good number of things that happen for a reason. For example, if you punch a brick wall and broke your fist, you broke your fist because you punched a brick wall. There is a direct cause and effect there. Similarly, if you committed a crime and went to jail, it’s because the crime you committed violates a particular law defined by the American legislative system. However, these are not the kind of things that the saying “Everything happens for a reason” refers to. This saying usually insinuates that if you committed a crime and went to jail, it’s because your life was headed in the wrong direction and you needed a wake up call. Or, if you punch a brick wall and broke your fist, you broke your fist because it’s a sign that if you don’t learn better anger management skills you will bring physical pain to yourself. These are the kinds of deductions that people make based on the simple cliche, “Everything happens for a reason”.</p>

<p>So, given the typical manner through which this saying is invoked, I completely disagree. You and your boyfriend didn’t break up because there is a better guy out there for you or because there is an opportunity you’d miss if you were still taken. You didn’t make a wrong turn on the way to dinner because you were meant to find a new restaurant that would later become your favorite restaurant. You didn’t go to work early the other day because there was a car crash that happened at the normal time you would have gone to work. Every time something out of the ordinary or unfair happens, it doesn’t happen because a wave of good fortune will hit you later. There is no fate.</p>

<p>I believe that nothing happens for a reason, but we give a reason to everything that happens.</p>

<p>Your relationship ended because you guys no longer got along. But, you’ll give a different, more hopeful reasoning to it: “This just means that there is some sort of opportunity coming up that I would have been too wrapped up in my boyfriend to previously see.” And you know what the best part is? Usually, the reason that we give to things is dead on! You probably do find an awesome opportunity now that you’re single. But it has nothing to do with your recent break up. In fact, the two events are mutually disjoint. However, because you put a different, more inspirational reasoning behind the break up, you opened your mind to the possibility of an opportunity surfacing and you actually attracted the opportunity.</p>

<p>This may seem like kind of an abstract way to think about this, but when you think about it, it makes sense. If you went to jail and cleaned up your life, do you really think that it’s likely that you were <em>meant</em> to go to jail because otherwise you wouldn’t have cleaned up your life? No. You cleaned up your life because you told yourself that the reason you went to jail is because you are supposed to clean up your life.</p>

<p>I do however, think that the saying “Everything happens for a reason” is one of the best widespread misconceptions. It brings optimism to some of the most pessimistic of situations. This is the saying that often enables us to give over the bad or unfair times and look toward a brighter and more positive future. And because of this, I fully support the belief in this mantra. I just don’t think that it is truly correct.</p>

<p>It is not fate that brings you happiness in dark times.  It’s you that brings you happiness in dark times.</p>

<p>Think about it.</p>
