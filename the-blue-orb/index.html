	<h2>The Blue Orb</h2>

		<p>I don’t really remember being born. I mean, I remember parts of it, but it’s not all entirely clear. From what I do remember though, birth was very different than most interpret it  to be.</p>

<p>You see, I remember nothingness. This deep, vast, black nothingness surrounded me. And I was floating. I was floating in this nothingness and there were no laws of physics governing anything, but then again there wasn’t anything to be governed by physics. Yet, there was me. And I remember being surrounded in this soft blue glow and floating in the pool of darkness. This blue glow embraced my entire being. It was a deep, spiritual connection that I had with this blue glow. All that existed in the infinite nothingness was me and this blue glowing ball of somethingness. Except I didn’t exist. There wasn’t me and there wasn’t anyone else. But, I was everyone else. And everyone else was this blue glowing orb. And this blue glowing orb was me.</p>

<p>And, I remember clearly the resonance of the blue glowing sphere. It was emitting light and sound at the frequencies that are most pleasurable to the eyes and ears. Except no one was there to hear it. And no one was there to see it. And the existence of the blue glowing orb is questionable. But there you were. And there I was. And there we were. Neither of us being anything except for each other, yet none of us being anything but this glowing blue orb which in itself was nothing but a small dab of somethingness in a vast void of nothingness.</p>

<p>This is the part that I remember most vividly about birth. The blue orb starts to grow vastly brighter and brighter and brighter until the light itself pulls our lack of existence deep into it’s core. Then, a sudden burst, an explosion if you will. A deep emotional explosion, a complete dissemination of somethingness across the entire void of nothingness. And in that moment, I remember coming to. And all of the sudden, I’m this minuscule piece of somethingness in this large void of nothingness. I remember being scared and desperately looking around, looking everywhere for the other billions of pieces of somethingness. The fear faded and suddenly here I was, a puzzle piece, with no prior knowledge to there ever being a puzzle.</p>

<p>I didn’t always remember my birth though. But, I remember how it came to me. A brilliant blue pulsing light wasn’t too far out in the distance. It was a strange, curious pulsating light. I followed it. As I got really close, I’m enveloped by this intense inner conflict. I’m having trouble making sense of this monster fighting inside of me because all I see is a guy wearing a fascinating glowstick necklace. And then it hits me. I’m completely taken over by this intense wave of pure, spiritual emotion. This was one of the happiest and most emotional moments that I can recall. I am standing here, staring longingly at this man wearing the glowstick necklace and crying deeply when the world makes sense. As tears roll down my cheeks, I look at everyone around me and notice the same blue glow. And then I look at myself. And I’m glowing blue. And then I look back at the crowd and no one exists. But everyone is glowing blue. And here in front of me are all of these parts of blue somethingness and in this moment nothing else exists. It was this moment when it all came back to me.</p>

<p>Every single soul on this Earth is a piece of somethingness in this horrible, lonely world of nothingness. Daily, we live ignorant of our birth and ignorant of our place in the universe but it’s there. And nothing exists but this blue glow within us all and maybe someday, we can all come together and once again be the blue glowing orb in this overwhelmingly infinite nothingness. For now, we live as broken pieces, unconscious of the whole, but oh is it beautiful to know that the whole exists.</p>

<p>Or maybe this was all just  a weird dream….</p>
