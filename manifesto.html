	<h1> A MANIFESTO</h1>
	<p>Everyone loves dogs. OK, some people claim they don't
	like dogs, but that's just a strange sense of pride. Let 
	us proceed on the totally correct assumption that everyone
	loves dogs.  </p>
	<h4>&</h4>
	<p>Sure, one might attempt to fufill that love with a pet dog.
	Maybe a person will buy three dogs even. To that I say, "What
	kind of priviledged bullshit!" If you can afford three dogs, 
	consider buying two MAX and then
	donating the $50/month you'll save to charity. </p>
<h4>&</h4>
	<p>Here's the point: no matter how many dogs you can afford, your
	love for dogs will never be properly satisifed. Why? The heart 
	longs for maximum warmth. Imagine snuggling 37 dogs. You want it, don't you?</p>
<h4>&</h4>
	<p>That's why I made this website. 37 dogs is a safe place for you to
	explore your love of dogs and grieve the fact that you will never
	physically exist in a cuddle puddle with 37 dogs.
<h4>&</h4>
	<p> Why 37? Well, uh, it's an intutive thing. 36 is not enough, and 38 is too many. 
37 is the digital cuddle-puddle sweet spot. Agree? Disagree? Email beef_anon @ 37dogs . com
