	<h2>Does Money Buy Happiness?</h2>

		<p>I used to be extremely tight with my money. I remember getting into fights with my girlfriend because I was too cheap to take her out to dinner. I was in high school, with a solid chunk of change in the bank and I wouldn’t even take my girlfriend out to dinner. I was so worried about saving that it affected the happiness of me and those around me. I was completely oblivious though.</p>

<p>It finally hit me one day after my girlfriend started telling me all about how she was going to be an extreme Couponer and save tons of money on groceries. My immediate thought was “Is it really worth it to spend hours obsessively organizing coupons just to save $1.50 on your next box of Oreos? Is it really worth taking hours to plan your entire grocery list based on what you have coupons for?” These were very hypocritical thoughts. Was it really worth missing out on a nice dinner and a movie one weekend just so that I could save 15 bucks? It was then that I realized it’s just not worth it.</p>

<p>That moment marked a change in the way I viewed money. The thing is, in today’s world, it’s extremely hard to live without money. Money enables people to buy whatever they want. It seems like money is what I should be pursuing. Money is what it was all about. Now though, I realize that <strong>money should not be the force that drives you, but a tool to help you along your journey.</strong> When you make money your primary goal, greed will overtake you and make you a victim of overconsumption. When money is simply a tool, all of the sudden it’s not so horrible to go to the movies every once and a while.</p>

<p>So, at this point, I was feeling a lot looser with my money, but I was still keeping things really under control and keeping my expenses low. One day, I walked passed a guy who had an extremely distraught look on his face. In obvious shame, he asked me if I could spare any money. I snook me head no and kept walking. Then, I checked my wallet and saw that I had two dollars. Usually, this wouldn’t have mattered, but on this day I felt oddly compelled to help this guy out. I turned around and walked towards the guy and explained that I looked in my wallet and saw that I actually did have some cash. I let him know that it was only two dollars, but it was all of the cash I had.</p>

<p>This guy stopped dead in his tracks. His jaw dropped. His eyes escaped a depressed position and showed signs of emotional bliss. “Oh! Man! Thank you man! Thank you so much man!” he screamed with the world’s most thankful expression on his face. He looked near tears as he walked off. I can’t explain the feeling that overtook me. I had no idea why this man needed money so badly. All I knew in that moment was that I didn’t need two dollars that much. You can’t assume that all people who ask for money are soul-sucking homeless people looking to buy booze. When we generalize like this and are stingy with our money, we miss out on simply indescribable, amazing experiences.</p>

<p>Now, I always try to hear a homeless guy out and give him cash if I have it. I have no idea how bad his life is or if he is even a good person. I do know though that I am a good person and that my life is good enough to spare a couple bucks. Even better than homeless guys are small groups playing instruments. The instrument gig gets a little more attention from people and passerbyers often throw a dollar or two in the guitar case. What people don’t do however, is listen. This talented people are essentially playing a free concert for you and because they are living off of the tip money, you can feel the passion in every note they play. I always stay and listen for at least five minutes and if I enjoy it, I pay a couple bucks for the concert. They need the money more than I do.</p>

<p>In summary, these experiences have completely transformed the way I view money. Now, I want to make enough money so that I can spare 20 bucks a week to go downtown and give away. If you don’t need the money, why not change someone’s life who does? The following is a really good TED talk that talks about the relationship between money and happiness.</p>

<p>Money spent on others buys happiness.</p>
