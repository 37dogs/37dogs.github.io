	<h2>Happiness through Effortlessness</h2>
	<time datetime="2012-05-30T16:20:00-04:00" class="by-line">30 May 2012</time>
	<div class="content">

		<p>There are two conflicting pieces of advice that we are often given:</p>
<ol>
	<li>"Do what makes you happy!"</li>
	<li>"Hard work pays off!"</li>
</ol>
<p>But, what if hard work doesn’t make you happy? I’m sure we’ve all had the times where we know we can do something, the times where we are fully aware that we are capable, but nonetheless we are absolutely miserable when doing it. We liked to define these times as ‘difficult’ or ‘hard’. In these times, it is the hard work it takes to complete the task that actually brings unhappiness. So if you are told to do what makes you happy, but this hard work makes you miserable, what do you do? Do you have a purpose? How can you bring meaning into your life?</p>

<p>The way I think about this paradox is as follows:</p>

<p>First of all, I believe that any one person is capable of anything. It sounds cliche, but I truly believe that any one person can do anything they want. It should be obvious that people laking innate skills or talent somehow still float their way to the top. In today’s world, charism, confidence, networking, and a college degree are more important than being naturally good at something. Even without the college degree, people wiggle their way up. Anyone can do anything if they have the desire, are absolutely confident they can do it, and they work hard.</p>

<p>However, the difficulty of each task is interpreted by each person differently. This interpretation has a lot to do with innate skill and ability, but I believe that it has more to do with desire. I am pretty good at Math. The reason Math comes easily to me is not because I was born good at Math. It’s because I have always had a desire to learn Math, a confidence in Math, and it has always been easy to push myself to exceed in Math. On the contrary, I am not very good at Music. This isn’t because I was born bad at Music. This is because I have always lacked a musical confidence and it has always been hard to push myself musically.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The difficulty of a task as perceived by a particular person is largely defined by said person’s confidence and desires in performing that task.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Naturally, this perception of difficulty will have an extremely large impact on the effort it takes a person to complete the task. Say there is a person named Jane who does not find Math a desirable subject. If Jane and I are in the same Math class, we will both be assigned the same amount of work. We will both have to work hard to get an A. It’s hard to argue that the amount of net work that one must do to achieve an A in any particular class is any more or less than the net work another member of the same class must achieve. The difference here is in the confidence and desires. I have a desire and a confidence in Math. This will change my perception of the difficulty of the course. The class will become <em>effortless </em>to me. It will still be hard work, but it will be effortless. Jane’s perception however, will make the class seem harder than it actually is and her confidence will go down. The mental aspect here plays a huge role in determining the final grade.</p>

<p>The point that I’m trying to make here is this:</p>

<p>In order to succeed, one must work hard. When someone tells you that if you work hard enough you will be rewarded, they are completely and totally correct. However, there are different tasks that our mind perceives to have different difficulty levels. Happiness, 100% of the time, will be achieved through hard work in a subject that your particular mind perceives as <em>effortless. </em>You will definitely have to work hard to be successful, but it doesn’t have to seem hard.</p>

<p>And this is a spot where I would like to insert a very appropriate Steve Jobs quote:</p>
<blockquote>"When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: 'If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right.' It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: "If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?" And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something."</blockquote>
