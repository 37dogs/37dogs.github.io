		<p>First of all, what is existentialism?</p>

<p>Existentialism is a branch of philosophy that basically seeks to find out the purpose of human existence.</p>

<p>Because of the nature of the course, the class is filled with 60 college kids who are all struggling to find out who they are. It’s beautiful in a sadistic sort of way to feel so much angst and to see so many lost faces. I wouldn’t try to say that I’m in the same place as all of these kids because everyone’s experiences have led them to approach these deeper sorts of questions in different ways, but the one thing that we have in common is that we are all lost.</p>

<p>As the professor has started to introduce existentialist ways of thinking, she’s made it obvious that existentialists view the masses as people who are not living a reflective or authentic lifestyle. Existentialists see the majority of people and believe that most people live a life according to the system. Their thoughts and opinions are not their own but instead thoughts placed in their heads through years of societal conditioning. Most people are trapped in the system and in turn lack individuality.</p>

<p>I think a lot of people have struggled with the issue of conformity and certainly most of the students in my existentialism class seemed to relate to what the professor was saying. Today, one kid raised his hand and asked, “If living our life in conformity is not living an authentic life, what other choice do we have? How can we survive in this systematic society and remain an authentic individual?” This exact question is something that I’ve struggled with for probably the past year of my life. I don’t want to do anything I don’t want to do but at the same time, how can I support myself without buying into the system and in turn losing a bit of my authenticity?</p>

<p>In response to this student’s question, the professor looks at him, pauses, and says, “That is a very good question.” Someone who has spent her entire life reading philosophy and searching for answers to life’s many questions, someone who gets paid to try and figure things out, someone with many more years of experience than any of us confused young adults had absolutely no idea how to answer the question. That’s because there is no definite answer. That’s the struggle. It’s obvious that if you focus on finding the answer, you’ll go mad. I think the key to living happily is not understanding human existence, but rather accepting the fact that we can never truly understand.</p>
