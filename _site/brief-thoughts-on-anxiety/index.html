	<h2>Brief Thoughts on Anxiety</h2>

	<div class="content">

		<p>I definitely have a certain level of social anxiety. It doesn’t prevent me from interacting with others on a social level, but it does hinder my social functions a little bit. In particular, I have trouble meeting people without being introduced by a mutual friend, I get really anxious during smalltalk-type conversations, and I will change my entire day’s plans to avoid being in the same place as somebody that I know but am not really friends with.</p>

<p>Today I was thinking about social anxiety a bit. People who don’t get socially anxious seem to intuitively interact with others. They don’t think twice about what they will say or how they will behave. I think constantly about it. I analyze the value of potential conversation before I even open my mouth. It’s obvious that this over-thinking is responsible for my social anxieties. However, underneath this layer or consciousness that picks apart all social situations, do I have the same intuitive sense of social interaction that normal people possess? Would it be possible then to learn to ignore the constant questioning and then just interact through intuition? If not, does that mean that the habit to question all social situations exists instead of the intuition for interacting with others?</p>

<p>Furthermore, are other anxieties caused by a similar reflective layer of thought in the brain? If you have anxiety for big tests, is that because you are constantly questioning whether or not you are prepared for the test? Is there a sense of relaxation underneath that layer of thought or does your anxiety replace the possibility of relaxation. Is anxiety treatable purely by training the brain to ignore the thoughts that question your abilities?</p>
