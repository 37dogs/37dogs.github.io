		<p>Life sucks. Right?</p>

<p>There’s always something that makes us upset, angry, frustrated, some sort of negative emotion and it gets to us. It’s hard to be genuinely happy. What if I told you that it didn’t have to be that way?</p>

<p>Take a look at all of the things you’ve complained about recently: He said this, she said that, I have so much homework, I’m so tired, I’m so hungry, It’s too hot, this food is cold, etc.</p>

<p>Now, say them out loud. Listen to what you are saying. It sounds ridiculous. It’s comical.</p>

<p>This is an exercise that I have recently developed to deal with my own frustrations and emotions. Every time I think a negative thought, I say it out loud and really listen to what I am saying. It almost always ends in laughter. It’s funny how a negative thought can actually result in a giddy spurt of laughter, a complete transformation of emotion by simply saying your thoughts out loud.</p>

<p>However, this trick won’t work if you have a constricted view of the world. What you have to understand is that the universe is absolutely GIANT. I would try to explain the magnitude, but I know I won’t be able to accurately get the point across. <a href="http://scaleofuniverse.com/">This website</a> does a fantastic job of illustrating just how small we really are. Despite what we’d like to think, we are not the kings of the universe. In fact, the sheer size of the universe hints at there inevitably existing extraterrestrial life that is far more intelligent than us.</p>

<p>So, when you look at the size of the universe and all that exists outside of YOU, your problems seem much smaller. Being late to work one day means absolutely nothing. It’s a small blip of chaos in an extremely chaotic universe, a universe that cares not about your problems. And that’s the humor of it all. It’s comical to think that we get upset about things that are unbelievably meaningless.</p>

<p>The best part about this trick is that it can bring you comedic relief even when you aren’t saying your own problems out loud. All around us, people are actively voicing their complaints and their concerns to friends, family, co-workers. You don’t even have to be too close to hear that John never called Katie after their date three weeks ago. While Katie’s world is ending, you can just sit and silently laugh at the sheer audacity of the conversation. And this is one of the reason why I enjoy being alone. I hear these people complaining and I leave wherever I am with this big, ridiculous, goofy grin.</p>

<p>This method of finding happiness in unlikely places is admittedly off-kilter, but it is effective.
&gt;
 <em>Knowing that we are all so silly makes life exponentially more enjoyable. Knowing that life itself is so silly makes it exponentially more enjoyable. </em></p>

<p>An extension of this that I have found to exist is that if you take everything slightly less seriously, amazing things will happen simply because you are more open to letting them happen. The only way that I can explain this is through a recent example of my own:</p>

<p>I woke up late on a Sunday. I text a few people to see if anyone wants to go brunch. No one does. Instead of getting bummed that I have no one to go with, I go to brunch by myself at my favorite restaurant, North Star. The food is taking forever to come out. I, again, evade disappointment and relax. When the food eventually does come, it comes with an apology from the manager and a coupon for a free meal. I have a worrying thought about getting homework done, think about it, and realize that getting homework done means very little. I think of how miserable I am on Sundays when I just stay in and attempt to get homework done. There’s so much of the the city I’ve never seen, so much I’ve never done. I have an incredibly boring life story. I walk downtown with no destination. I see more of Columbus on this Sunday than I have seen the entire year. I find two four leaf clovers. Three hours later, I’m lost. I think about it and laugh at how funny the situation is. I keep walking because I trust that life will work itself out without me worrying about it. I get a random phone call. My friend is in town and he’s looking to go to dinner or something. Honestly, nothing could have been more perfect. He picks me up and we go again to my favorite restaurant where I enjoy a soothing peppermint tea.</p>

<p>So, the negatives of the day (no one wanting to go to brunch, food taking forever, having homework to get done, being super lost) were completely and entirely transformed into amazingly serendipitous positives (getting a free meal, getting to see the city, finding two four leaf clovers, meeting up with my friend, and going to my favorite restaurant twice in one day).</p>

<p>None of this would have happened if I wouldn’t have laughed at the negatives. None of it. I would have stayed inside as a recluse, surfing the internet all day.</p>
