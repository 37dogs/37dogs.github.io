<p>Not too long ago, at a delicious thai restaurant, I received a seemingly ordinary fortune cookie after finishing my lunch. I opened up the fortune cookie and ah-ha! it was indeed an ordinary fortune cookie! I ate the cookie and pocketed the fortune, not thinking much of it. Then I went on to continue my ordinary life as an ordinary intern at an ordinary company. All was well.</p>

<p>I get home from work, feeling ordinary and pondering the direction in which I want to lead my life. While I struggle with the idea of continuing my current path and committing to one subject forever, I reach my hands into my pockets to clear their contents to my kitchen table.</p>

<p>“Credit card, Driver’s license, chapstick, cell phone, WHAT IS THIS MYSTERIOUS LITTLE PIECE OF PAPER? Ayy.. it is that completely ordinary fortune from that ordinary fortune cookie. But, why in this very moment does it seem so compelling, so mysterious this little ordinary fortune!?”</p>

<p>A supernatural power overtakes me and I unfold this fortune and re-read it to myself. I read it out loud and slower than before, “You know where you are going and how to get there”. Wow, here I was worrying so much about committing to one major and spending my entire life doing one thing. This fortune isn’t so ordinary after all. It came to me at the perfect time in my life. I started to think about what the words in the fortune implied and started to feel the emotions which they carried. This is when it hit hard.</p>

<p>I don’t need to worry about making any decisions right now that might restrict me in some other way intellectually. I don’t need to worry about anything. The truth of the matter is, I already know where I’m going and I know exactly how to get there. Everyday, I over think everything when what I need to do is simply not think at all. I’ll get to where I’m going. If I don’t worry about it and just do what feels right, I’ll enjoy a quick journey there. If I over think things and try to force a journey, it will be a long, sad, miserable journey.</p>

<p>I put this fortune on my fridge so that I can give myself a daily reminder that I know where I’m going. Going forward, I’m just going to do what feels right and work hard to do it well. One day, everything around me will just fall into place and I don’t need to worry so much about where and how that will occur.</p>

<p>Read your fortune cookies thrice, slower each time.</p>
