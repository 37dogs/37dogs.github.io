		<p>The following is a slightly odd and abstract view of death, but it’s something that I think about often.</p>

<p>Death is a scary thought so the majority of us put it at the back of our mind as long as we can. Life goes on and the thought of death rarely comes up because it’s so far in the future. “Death couldn’t happen to me now. I’m only X years old!”.</p>

<p>I disagree. Death knows no time. It’s spontaneous. Death, like life, is always instantaneously within reach. Keeping us alive is but a series of extremely fortunate events.</p>

<p>This train of thought is best explained through example:
- Right now, as you read this, all the biology and chemistry that make up your being are working together to keep you alive. At any given moment, a cell could spontaneously disagree or mutate into a cell that does not agree (cancer). However, at this given moment, all of your cells are working together at least enough to keep you alive. It’s a beautiful thing really. 100 trillion cells, 206 bones, 600 muscles, and 22 organs all working together at this very moment to keep you alive.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>As that example may seem a bit of a stretch, what about walking on the edge of the street? You could jump, trip, or be pushed into the street at any given moment. Perfect timing ensued, instant death would follow.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Driving is a big one. One sudden jerk of the steering wheel could not only kill you, but many others. Think about how close you are to death while driving.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While playing sports it only takes one extremely hard hit to the head. Just one. Similarly, there are stories of young athletes hearts who just give out while playing sports. Death isn’t far away then either.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Death is all around us and it is always within reach.</p>

<p>Though the thought of death is generally labeled as depressing, I like to think of the positives of knowing that death is only an instant away at all times. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc">In a 2005 commencement address at Stanford University</a>, Steve Jobs said:</p>
<blockquote>“Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life”

“Because almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure — these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.

You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.”</blockquote>
<p>I think there is a lot to that. Death is inevitable and if we spend our entire life preparing for life, we will die before we ever live.</p>

<p>Another positive that I take from knowing death’s closeness is life. If death is always within reach, how can we take life for granted? Every instant your life continues is more beautiful than the last and every instant, you look around and see that life is everywhere, in full bloom. Our world is full of life despite death being such a viable alternative. It’s beautiful.</p>
