		<p>Thinking, truly thinking, is a dangerously beautiful thing. It’s as much as a blessing as it is a burden and it’s hard to explain.</p>

<p>The American Dream is to do well in school, go to college, do well in college, get a good job, marry, have kids, retire, die. Isn’t it strange that we can generalize a dream? Does that even make sense? Here we are, a nation of 300 million individuals, and society says the path each one of them should take is this one? Where the college population of 19.7 million, we all supposed to be pursuing this exact “dream”?</p>

<p>I recently woke up. We are individuals, yet we let society direct our lives. Looking at it now, it seems so strange that this is standard. I don’t want to sit down with my grandkids, talking about my life, and tell them that I did well in school, went to college for four plus years, got a good job, and now work 9 to 5 every day. It doesn’t matter how cool your job is, that’s not an exciting story. In fact, it’s the same story as everyone else. There’s nothing unique about that path.<strong> </strong><em>We only live once so why is everyone so set on following the same path of those before them? </em></p>

<p>This awakening of course brought rise to many other life questions. What other thoughts do I have that society governs? I started consciously thinking about my ideals. It was important to me to realize whether the ideal came as a result of my own thoughts or was directly copied from those around me. I realized that there are plenty of things in every day life that society says must be. We live in this box. Inside the box, there are certain rules and restrictions and everyone loves to openly bitch about these constraints. This creates the hate and frustration and general chaos that is life. What I’ve realized though is that we don’t have to stay in the box. There are other solutions. If you let rules be simply guidelines, the possibilities are endless. Seeing the box from the outside, you quickly realize how silly everything is. Anger, frustration, and hate usually all result from a difference in ideals or a misunderstanding between two people. When it comes down to it though, we aren’t really that different. In fact, we are all the same. Why can we not embrace the difference in ideals and collaborate, learn from one another? Isn’t individuality a beautiful thing? Getting out of this box is comforting. There’s a whole new world where free thought can govern happiness and emotions are not dependent on anything or anyone. <em>Ultimately, I decide my fate. I decide my emotions. I decide my views on things. </em>This is the thing that most people do not realize. No matter what the rules are, no matter what other people do or say, I am the controller of my reaction, physically, emotionally and intellectually, to these things. This is the blessing of thinking, truly thinking.</p>

<p>On the other side, thinking can be the main driver for depression. When the mind is capable of wandering, wandering it does. It’s not hard to transition from the typical questions that are pertinent to every day life to questions that are much deeper. My mind is constantly filled with questions such as: Why is there something rather than nothing? What is there? Is there a point to existence? What matters? Similarly, when you accept the fact that everything outside of scientific discoveries is merely a matter of opinion, you realize that subjects such as religion may not be so black and white. So then my mind is haunted with questions such as: Is there a God? If yes, what do Christians have right? If no, what is there? Can we possibly be a random combination of genetic material evolved from simple organic molecules over billions of years? But, you can’t deny the fact that evolution does exist and because of this, what was God’s role in our creation? Did he create a universe and then everything just evolved? Is he responsible for physical and mathematical laws that govern the universe? How far did he plan into the future? Why do we assume he takes the human form? What existed before God?</p>

<p>These are the kinds of questions that constantly plague my mind. It’s a beautiful thing to be able to compose and ask such questions and being curious about the world around me is certainly an enjoyable thing, however, it is often times hard to deal with. The amount of information that we simply do not know is astounding and being conscious of this vast emptiness is tough. Organized religion can answer most, if not all, of these questions with their opinions and ideals and I think that a lot of people practice religion purely for the moral and emotional support it provides. However, skepticism consumes me far too much to join such a group.</p>

<p>This is my very primitive attempt at trying to explain the duality of thought. Being a free thinker does not come without repercussions, but I think that becoming comfortable with asking these questions and participating in a little self exploration in search for the answers is key to my happiness. When it all breaks down, being able to think about things that no one else would ever even consider thinking about is something I wouldn’t give up for the world.</p>

<p>Signing off, I want to reference an extremely <a title="Soundtrack to my life" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca3hhFfFH-k">relevant Kid Cudi song</a>. I like to at least think that Kid Cudi is similarly a thinker and this is why most of his music really hits me at home. Soundtrack 2 My Life has a few lyrics that I can really relate to:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>“and I get both, never truly satisfied, I AM HAPPY, thats just the saddest lie!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Looking at my life from an outside view point, it looks perfect. There’s nothing about my life that I should complain about. I get whatever I need and am confident in my ability to do whatever I want successfully, yet I’m never truly satisfied.</p>

<blockquote>"Ignorance to cope, man, ignorance is bliss,

Ignorance is love and I need that shit,"</blockquote>
<p>Ignorance is a truly beautiful thing. Often times, I find myself wishing that I could fall into ignorance. Not thinking about things and simply letting society control your life produces a lot of people that seem happier than me. It would be nice to similarly be ignorant. In the end though, I like to believe that a freethinker, though usually less happy, has a greater capacity for happiness.</p>
