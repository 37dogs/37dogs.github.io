		<p>Looking for something to do in Findlay, OH is no small task. Options are limited and when it’s all said and done, it’s probably better just to post up with a good book on the back porch and just absorb the nothingness. However, this weekend we decided to venture out and explore the mall area of Findlay.</p>

<p>There’s not much to do in a mall that isn’t shopping. So, we spent the day shopping. Shopping usually invokes a desire to buy things. It’s not hard to see a pair of shoes, or a new shirt and think “I could use this!” or “I want that”. This weekend, I was in American Eagle trying on a pair of khaki pants. After I tried them on, my roommate asks me how they fit to which I respond “They fit great. Now, it’s just a matter of if I want to buy them or not”. In response to this, my roommate asks a kind of deep and loaded question, “Can you live without them?”</p>

<p>“Can I live without them? Well, of course I can live without them”, I think to myself as I re-shelf the pants. And then I get to thinking even more. There is nothing at the mall that I can’t live without. I don’t need anything more than what I already have. Heck, even what I already have is more than I need. In fact, I’ve lived my entire life in excess. I’ve always had more than I need. You can look at excess in a multitude of different ways. I see it four different ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>It’s a “just in case” thing.</strong> The more you have, the more you’ll be prepared for the un-expected scenarios that will inevitably occur.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is can be a good thing.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>It’s fueled by a constant desire to always want more.</strong> It’s a common conception that to live in luxury and ultimate comfort, you need more things. A bigger house will make you happier. A pool will make you happier. The Mercedes Benz will make you happier. Having 100 different outfits to choose from will make you happier.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think for some, this might be true. A lot of people will argue that money can’t buy happiness, but I don’t really believe in absolutes. I think that for some people, having all of that stuff will legitimately make them happy. And that’s okay.</p>

<p>For most though, I don’t think that happiness is achieved by the acquiring of things. I am guilty of assuming this and I still buy things that I can’t resist in the moment. However, it’s always just an temporary shot of materialistic happiness that wears off rather quickly. A lot of people associate this feeling as ‘boredom’ with that particular thing. When boredom occurs, people buy a newer thing as a replacement to again bring them temporary happiness. Because of this, material induced happiness sometimes just feels dirty or false.</p>

<p>This is not a good thing.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>It can be a stressful distraction.</strong> The more things you have, the more you have to keep track of. Often times, you even need things for your things (accessories, add-ons, etc.) It’s also extremely easy to develop an emotional connection to things. You want to keep things because they remind you of something or because you got them at a certain place at a certain time with a certain person. This can be a good thing, but having boxes of things like these can make things cluttered and distracting.</li>
</ol>

<p>It can also be stressful or distracting because you will feel the need to tend to your things. If you bought it, you will feel the need to use it to rectify your purchase. If you don’t use it, it was essentially a useless purchase. The more things you have to use, the less time you have to do what you really want to do. When you stop using these things, they can pile up and create more clutter. It’s hard to throw them away though because of point 1.</p>

<p>This is not a good thing.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Things can tie you down.</strong> If you have a lot of things, but are moving, you’ll need a moving truck or a fleet of cars. You’ll have to take a day or two to pack and another day or two to unpack. With this in mind, it’s not easy to want to relocate and experience different parts of the state, country, or world. Things make it very easy to be a hermit and get bored with your surroundings.</li>
</ol>

<p>To me, this is not a good thing.</p>

<p>For every individual, the viewpoint of excess can be different, but the above four are just my particular views on the matter. Usually, I’m thinking about keeping things that I might one day need, so 1 applies a lot. When it comes to new technology, 2 consumes me. Every new smartphone, computer, or tablet that comes out, I want to get my hands on and play with. For some reason, I feel obligated to know everything about the newest tech and to be able to speek from an unbiased viewpoint when people ask me tech related questions. Then, 3 and 4 occasionally plague me and I reflect back on what I actually need. What in my life can I live without? It’s a constant inner struggle.</p>

<p>When my roommate asked me if I could “live without it”, it hit pretty hard. I immediately retreated to the role of a conservative consumer with a lock on my wallet. I wasn’t buying any clothes at the mall. Later, I found myself in the shoe section thinking that I actually might need a new pair of shoes. While I walked through the aisles, I heard a mother exclaim to her child, “But, you already have a pair of running shoes!” It was as if the God of minimalism was speaking to me. I too, already had a pair of running shoes. And ~10 other pairs of shoes. I didn’t need another pair of shoes. It was just another want.</p>

<p>So, what do I need, then? What is too much?</p>

<p>I think that ‘too much’ has to be determined on an individual basis. Some minimalists will guarantee that only having X things and nothing else will make you happiest. I don’t agree with this. As I said earlier, I believe that some people are happiest with a lot of things. For most people though, I think that the max happiness occurs when you have only the things that you use on a regular basis, the things you need in order to do your job, and the things you need in order to provide yourself with food and shelter. I also do not think that the number of things you have should ever tie you down. If a change in your life will help breed happiness, it is imperative that the things you have do not make you less inclined to make that change. I have come up with a list of things that I need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A week’s worth of clothes and one dressy outfit.</li>
  <li>3 pairs of shoes: Running shoes, soccer cleats, and casual shoes.</li>
  <li>My computer, iPad, and phone.</li>
  <li>A table/desk and chair to sit in.</li>
  <li>A ceramic mug, a plate, silverware, and a to-go mug/water bottle.</li>
  <li>Shower stuff.</li>
  <li>Notebooks and writing/drawing/coloring utensils.</li>
  <li>Pillow and sleeping bag.</li>
  <li>A bike.</li>
  <li>A car.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think that this short list of things is all that I need. It enables me to live the life that I want to live and it prevents me from living completely consumed in things. With only these things, I can travel easily and pack quickly and I won’t ever feel grounded. Also, without having to worry about things I can focus on experiences instead.</p>

<p>After my roommate asked me if I really needed those pants, I’ve been thinking a lot about what can bring me happiness if not things and I came to the conclusion that experiences are the most important thing to me. This hasn’t always been the case, and I didn’t even explicitly recognize the transition. However, sometime recently I’ve begun to appreciate experiences way more than I used to. At some point recently, I became more likely to sink $150 dollars in a road trip than in an iPod nano. I think this is a very important transition in my life. Like I listed above, I think that desiring and accumulating things can have negative impacts on my life. Also, things expire. Eventually, you’ll have to buy a new things. Experiences can accumulate and build desire with no negative impacts. The more experiences you have, the easier it is for you to see life through other perspectives. And, experiences form memories and relationships that never expire.</p>

<p>Additionally, Boredom comes from experiencing the same thing over and over or dealing with the same thing over and over. There are two solutions to boredom: create new experiences or buy new things. There are only so many things money can buy, but there is not limit on the amount of experiences a person can have. If boredom occurs, get outside you’re normal routine and experience something different!</p>

<p>Our experiences define who we are. Our thoughts, our feelings, positions on political or social issues, our interest in certain subjects, everything about our present self, is shaped by what we’ve experienced. But, our things have very little impact on who we are or who we will become. Sure, there are certain tools that do help us along the way, but overall, having an excess of things does not build us into a better or stronger person.</p>
