	<h2>Outside the Comfort Zone</h2>
	<time datetime="2012-08-26T17:08:00-04:00" class="by-line">26 Aug 2012</time>
	<div class="content">

		<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.highexistence.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/417215_10150525283751693_115355596692_9104012_1763534159_n1.jpg" alt="" width="579" height="399" /></p>

<p>I saw the above image a while back and it had a significant effect on me. At the time, I was interviewing random people as part of a side project which was certainly a little bit outside my comfort zone but I hadn’t really reflected on how happy it made me. With every person I met, I saw a different story that was at least as complex as my own life story and often times far more complex. I saw new ideas. New passions. New thoughts and opinions. I gained insight into how people can see the world differently than I could and started to find these differences in perspective fascinating rather than annoying. I think that this experience caused me to grow as a person far more than any other experience had in my life and it would have never happened had I not stepped outside my comfort zone.</p>

<p>Looking at this graphic online and reflecting on the magic that happened this summer, I started to think about other ways that I could get outside of my comfort zone and find more magic in life. At the time, I was finishing up a summer internship in Columbus and had a full two weeks before I had to moved to another city and start another internship. The problem was, the lease on my apartment was up and I still had a week of work.</p>

<p>Now, I have friends in Columbus and knew I could find a place to stay, but this graphic came to mind. I started looking at Couch Surfing to see if I could find a place to stay. Couch Surfers is a decently reliable site where people who love to travel host travelers. From what I’ve experienced, it’s a pretty awesome community of weird and eclectic individuals. I decided that I wanted to do it. I reached out to Kyle who seemed to be a pretty cool guy. He was young, loved soccer, and seemed laid back. That worked for me.</p>

<p>Kyle ended up being an awesome dude and was a fabulous host. (He even left work early for me!) We had dinner and then went back to his place and played Fifa and he introduced me to Arrested Development. This experience was definitely weird as hell, but I’m really glad that I did it because I had a good time and am less afraid to do it in the future. Also, I didn’t die! Above all though, I got to meet yet another interesting person this summer and get some insight on his perspective on life. If you ever need a place to stay in Columbus, I recommend <a href="http://www.couchsurfing.org/profile.html?id=CB40HIK&amp;from_search&amp;search_ranking_hosts=16">contacting Kyle.</a> He’s a great dude and he’s trying to build up a solid Couch Surfing reputation so that it’s easier for him to find a host the next time he travels internationally.</p>

<p>This is just a recent example of me stepping outside of my comfort zone and happily adding to my list of life experiences. I truly believe that there is a certain level of happiness that can only be obtained through stepping outside of your comfort zone and I just wanted to share my experience as a way to influence others to follow suit. Going forward, I’m going to try and adopt this as a style of life so that I can be constantly reminded that life is about so much more than what’s in my comfort zone.</p>
