		<p>I made the mistake of getting on Facebook today, the day after an election. The aftermath was real and Facebook looked tired and abused. I noticed a lot of angry rants from high school/college students that were based off of what I believe to be misinformation. Though the content of these posts was certainly diverse, I think that most of it centered around jobs. My personal opinions almost swayed me to write a frustrated and bitter post, but after thinking about it I realized that exactly zero people would benefit from that kind of post. Instead, I want to give five tips to getting a job right out of college that work whether Obama positively, negatively, or neutrally affects the job market in these next four years.</p>

<p><strong>How to Come out of College on Top and Be Sure to Get a Job</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Attitude</strong>
I truly believe that attitude is the number one way to ensure a job out of college. If you look at things from the viewpoint of “there’s not even going to be a job for me”, I can assure you that there won’t be a job for you. If you pursue the attitude “there are going to be plenty of jobs and I’ll get to choose which one I want to do” you’re opening yourself up to the possibility of jobs being available. Negativity creates closed mindedness. Closed mindedness can make a person ignorant on available opportunities. Keep a positive attitude!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Passion</strong>
Passion is one of the most underrated attributes in obtaining a job. People pursue careers specifically because of their projected income. This can get you in trouble if the job market is scarce. Passion is something that is hard to fake, and extremely easy to perceive. It takes 30 seconds of talking to someone about a subject before you can tell if they are passionate about it or not. Employers can see this too. If an employer sees that you are excited about what you are doing and that you show a strong desire to not only perform your duty, but to also go above and beyond, if an employer sees that you are willing to go the extra mile not because you are sucking up, but because you just truly love what you do, it’ll make a HUGE difference in determining your value as a potential employee. Alongside passion is a willingness to learn. 9 times out of 10 an employer takes the less experienced employee who is excited to learn over the more experienced employee who doesn’t really want to further expand his knowledge.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Stand out</strong>
The third most important thing to securing a job when you get out of college is standing out. This can mean multiple different things. If you are a person that can work their butt off in school and get A’s, that’ll certainly help you stand out, however I don’t think that’s the best way to stand out. The best way to stand out is something that anybody in school can do: Network. There isn’t enough that can be said for networking. The real world really is all about who you know and the quicker you learn that, the better. College should be a time for you to expand your professional circle so that a job floats itself into your lap. Expanding your professional circle can be done by creating a relationship with your professors, searching for research opportunities in your department, joining local community groups that you would identify with, or pursuing an internship. And saying that you can’t do any of those things is complete bullshit. You would be amazed at how receptive professors are if you show the desire to learn. Even if you don’t have a great grade in the class, showing up to office hours and showing the professor that you not only care about your grade, but you also care about furthering your knowledge, you have the potential to create a meaningful relationship with that professor. Anyone can do it. Anyone.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cheat</strong>
Though I don’t condone cheating, it can be a very effective tactic to getting a job out of college. Looking at a prediction of what jobs will be available in large numbers after you graduate will give you a very good idea of where it will take the least amount of effort to get a job. For example, the technology industry is still booming so choosing to pursue a degree in Computer Science primarily for that reason will give you a greater chance of getting a job after college. The biggest risk with cheating like this is completing ridding yourself of passion. Passion is extremely important in obtaining a job and if you can’t find a way to get passionate about it, there’s a good chance it’s not worth it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Hard work</strong>
Every one of those 4 steps require an intense amount of hard work. Sometimes it seems like a lot of young people want a job to be handed to them with their college degree. That is not how to real world works. If you want it, you have to grab it. There is no other option. Hard work and determination will allow you to keep a positive attitude and stand out during your college career.</p>
