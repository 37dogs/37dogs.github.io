A while back, I saw this image.

I thought it was beautiful and it really resonated with me at the time because I was particularly unhappy with the direction I was headed. Since then, I've been changing my life in a way that allows me to discover more so I'm not so confined to this same place. Interestingly though, I stumbled upon it again a few days ago and it had a very different effect on me.

Why do we need to run? Perhaps instead of seeing the birds stationary nature as a negative attribute, we should observe how functional and happy the birds are despite not knowing anywhere but where they are born and where they grow up. A bird native to Ohio has never been to Europe and it has no interest in doing so. The bird stays in the same place because it knows no other place.

This made me start thinking. The number of places that we could travel in the world are infinite. We cannot possibly see everything there is to see in the world in our lifetime. Additionally, human knowledge is increasing at a rate that we couldn't keep up with even if we knew everything that has ever been known by any human right now. Yet, we want to run. We want to know. I think this can also be looked at from a romantic angle. When things start getting serious, you might wonder "Is this guy/girl right for me? Is there someone else that would be better for me?".

One of the beautiful things about being a human is that we can imagine alternative realities. We can play a slideshow of our future lives in our head to help us decide which choices to make. However, I would also argue that this is one of the largest hindrances. To constantly imagine a different reality can be depressing, especially in today's world. There are infinite realities. You can devote your life to learning all information and you will never be satisfied. You can devote your life to seeing all there is to see and you will never be satisfied. You can devote your life to meeting every other person besides your significant other to give you a confidence check that he/she is the one and you will never be satisfied.

I think in today's world, the fact that we are conscious and well aware of all the different possible paths our lives could take breeds unhappiness amongst us all. Man lives his life and he constantly asks himself "Is there a field that would make me happier?", "Is there a woman that is better for me as a partner?", "Is there a place where I would be happier living?". Once you ask the question, the answer is always yes. Simply by asking have negatively impacted your happiness which allows for the possibility of something else making you happier. Had you never asked the question, you would have never entertained the possibility of doing anything else and therefore never would have negatively impacted your happiness. Because of this, I see these types of questions as extremely destructive.

I think that we should avoid these destructive questions completely because I don't believe that there exists a solution. I think that with a world our size, a pool of knowledge so vast, and with 7 billion people on the planet, you can always change your life in a way that you would be equally happy and then perceive it as a increase in happiness because of the decrease in your happiness created by the formulation of the initial question. However, I think that once you're happy there is no happier. Embracing your situation and acting with compassion and love towards those around you is a better way to be happy. Additionally, escaping a happy situation in pursuit of something that could make you happier can leave behind emotional baggage that will hinder you in achieving the same level of happiness in the future.

In today's society we are lead to believe that we have a specific professional calling or a one true love. That's complete bullshit. Just because you are naturally good at math and science doesn't mean you were born to be an engineer, but rather that you are apt to do so. Similarly, just because you and a romantic interest get along swimmingly and are really happy doesn't mean that you are destined for each other. I would wager to guess that another profession could satisfy you just as well and that another romance could suffice. However, believing that we are destined for particular futures helps the mind stop asking destructive questions. If you believe you were meant to do it, it's harder to be unhappy. Looking at historical social structures, it is easy to see examples of how this worked and how they broke down when someone failed to believe that they were meant for that position (i.e. slavery, feudalism).

Please note that these thoughts are coming from somebody who has allowed these types of destructive questions to rule his life and still continues to do so. I have absolutely no idea how to stop my brain from asking if I can't find something better, but I am entertaining the idea that once I can do that, I can be happy anywhere under any circumstances.
