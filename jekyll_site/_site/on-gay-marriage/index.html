		<p>Laws are good.</p>

<p>Laws protect the people. I think that it’s agreeable that the main premise of laws is exactly that. In general, the governing body creates these laws to protect the basic rights and well-being of its citizens. Fair enough.</p>

<p>Now what baffles me is that if this is our political goal, shouldn’t laws only be passed if what they are outlawing has a negative effect on people? For example, outlawing murder makes sense because it has a negative effect on the general population and that is easy to see, but wouldn’t outlawing wearing white on Wednesdays seem silly? Sure, some people may be offended when people wear white on Wednesdays, but it doesn’t harm anyone and the people who are offended can simply ignore it or not hang around these people.</p>

<p>The media has been plastered with talk about Gay Marriage lately and I think it’s obviously a pretty controversial topic. Why so big recently though? Obama recently announced support of Gay Marriage and NC recently outlawed it completely.</p>

<p>Here’s my take on the matter: Why is this an issue?</p>

<p>The way I see it, we are repeating history at a lesser intensity. Before the Civil Rights Movement, everyone considered blacks to be property. It seemed ridiculous to think that they would ever be more than property. Now this sickens me to think about, but it must have been rather customary during that time. As a nation, we rose above that hatred and prejudice and we are still fighting racism today. However, those who supported the complete set of rights for blacks rose above and pushed morals onto others. Now, it is considered unethical and morally wrong to treat blacks any worse than whites.
And now we, as a nation, are faced with a similar struggle. Albeit at a completely different level, but a similar struggle nonetheless. Why are gays any different that straight people? Alan Turing, responsible for modern day computing, was gay.  Ellen DeGeneres is gay. Neil Patrick Harris is gay. Your friend, roommate, cousin, son, daughter, brother, uncle, friend’s friend’s friend is gay. And they are all struggling to feel normal. I try to put myself in their shoes and realize that if society told me that I couldn’t like girls, I would be so devastated and hurt inside. It must take a lot of courage to even step up and admit to being gay.</p>

<p>So people all around us are gay and they are already struggling because society says they are gross and unnatural and a bad example for the children. What I don’t understand about this is why we care. If two people of the same sex being together offends you, that is perfectly okay. I’ll probably try to get you to soften up to the idea a bit, but in the end it’s your decision and I can’t rob you of your opinions. However, trying to rob someone that weirds you out of their rights to be happy is simply unmoral. <em>This isn’t a fight for homosexual equality, this is a fight for human equality.</em></p>

<p>You know what weirds me out? Marylyn Manson. That dude is off his rocker. The general idea of some of the stuff he does makes me cringe and yet, I’m not trying to outlaw him touring in my city. Similar to the fight for racial equality, the fight for gay rights will end as well. But, it is not going to end with gay marriage being outlawed. If everyone against gay marriage just shut up and let people live their lives and be happy, homosexuality in general wouldn’t be so “in your face”. The protests would slow and gays would live happily with the one they love <em>just like every heterosexual couple.</em></p>

<p>As for those who try and argue that marriage is a religious union between two people and because gays are essentially outlawed by Christianity they can’t get married, they need to just cut the bullshit. Marriage is an emotional and spiritual connection between two people who love each other. Atheists get married. Muslims get married. Hindus get married. Buddhists get married. Jews get married. Tell me how gays can’t get married because it’s against God’s word. It honestly makes me unreasonably upset that people can be as ignorant as to say that gays shouldn’t marry because marriage is only a religious thing. If I love somebody and am so deeply emotionally connected to that person, I don’t think it matters what my religious preferences or sexual preferences are. I should be able to take that relationship to the next level and make a pact with that person that I will love them and be with them forever.</p>

<p>Now, if you’re one of those who says that marriage is a sacred covenant between man and woman and gays ruin that, you also need to wake up. The divorce rate is at an all time high. Marriage is obviously not as sacred to all of the Christians as they say it is. If you’re on your third wife, how are you going to go out and say that marriage is sacred and a gay couple is going to ruin it?</p>

<p>Now what about those that argue that children need a mom and dad? Well, you’re out of touch with reality too. How can you honestly argue that a child growing up with two dads is worse off than a children growing up torn between two divorced parents? The child isn’t going to always think that everyone has two dads and the child is definitely not destined to be gay if he has gay parents. The child will get his own exposure to the real world and grow up understanding heterosexual life and behavior just as well as homosexual life and behaviors.</p>

<p>I understand that this rant isn’t particularly effective, but with all the media lately the ignorance of some people is killing me and I am using this to vent. I wish I could paint a more effective illustration of exactly how I feel because to me, it honestly doesn’t make any sense how anybody could deprive humans of basic rights.</p>

<p>If gay marriage isn’t hurting isn’t it just as ridiculous as outlawing wearing white on Wednesdays? This is history in the making here and if you’re not in support of basic human equality, you’re going to look like the jack ass when gays are no longer gays but are simply people. Don’t be on the wrong side of history.</p>
