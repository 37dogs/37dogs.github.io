- To dance with you in the golden hour
- To be silly with you amongst the sunflower
- To laugh with you as we both fall down
- To lay with you, our backs to the ground
- To converse with you, our eyes tell the tale
- To hold you tight as the evening turns stale
- To escape with you to a world unknown
- To exist with you, where our feelings have grown
- In this moment with you, we're the only ones here
- In an embrace with you, our bodies so near
- In silence with you, this feels so right
- In love with you as we watch day turn to night
- As the sun slowly sets, it's energy released
- I feel it go through me, I get weak in the knees
- Under the night sky with you, the stars shining bright
- I see a shooting star and wish for you tonight
- We fall deeply asleep, our bodies tangled together
- We lose track of time, can we just stay here forever?
