- It only takes one to prove wrong.
- A whole life's focus,
- a solemnly song.
- Working for something,
- turned nothing feels wrong.
- Then should goals we choose,
- be short and not long?
- There isn't an answer,
- that's right and not wrong.
- For even the short ones,
- sing solemnly song.
