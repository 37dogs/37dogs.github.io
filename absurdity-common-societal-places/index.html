		<p>Perspective is perhaps my favorite topic. I love thinking, writing, and talking about perspective. I think about perspective a lot and this past summer. I believe that perspective is all that segregates and divides humans and I believe that if we all see life through each other’s windows instead of our own, the world would be a more peaceful place. We tend to hear people talk about one subject and instinctively refute it because we don’t agree. It’s not often that we calmly ask why they believe what they do in a completely non-condescending tone. Even if we do ask why, we usually aren’t even open to their perspective. Being open to any and all perspectives is not easy and allowing your hard-set believes to become a little more variable and tentative is even harder. However, I think the implications of doing this successfully are huge. A more open mind is one that can see things from the point of view of others.</p>

<p>This weekend, perspective hit me in a little more abstract way. I started to think about the perspective through which we perceive common societal places. You can also get deep in the perspective through which we view common societal actions or expectations, but I’m not going to get into that much here. Most of my thought focused on viewing common places through a different lens. If I had to describe the lens that I was looking through on Saturday night, I would say that it was an almost instinctual one. I also do want to note that these were not exactly new thoughts, but rather a deeper extension of things that I had thought about before. There were four places that I primarily thought about, but you could use a similar lens to look at other places. To explain what’s going on in my strange, strange brain, I think I’ll just go through each of these four places and describe them using an unusual perspective.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Public bathrooms</strong>
Humans have built entire rooms for the single purpose of releasing waste. Underneath these rooms is an entire infrastructure of piping that controls and moves the waste to a processing facility. Let’s think about this for a second. Someone had to sit down and think “Hey how can I move my shit from the place where I shit to another place so that the place where I shit isn’t so shitty?”. They then had to design the mechanisms and the infrastructure and it had to be able to take a full load plus paper and move it to somewhere else. Now think about this from an instinctual viewpoint. Humans have the desire to relieve themselves of waste. It’s a natural occurrence and all animals do it. What other animals concern themselves as much with the matter as us humans though? Could you imagine digging into an ant hill and seeing that all the ants have found a way to route their shit to one place? No. Ants just shit wherever they want. But why don’t humans do that? Over population stopped that from being a possibility and for some reason as we evolved, we decided that a natural body process such as relieving waste was gross and should be done in private. The whole thing is just incredibly strange if you think about it. We go into these rooms and lock a door in front of us and sit on their oddly shaped porcelain box, relieve ourselves and exit all while trying to make sure the smallest amount of people know. It’s a completely natural process. It’s just interesting to think about how and why we evolved to think of using the restroom this way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Gyms</strong>
A long, long time ago food wasn’t as easy for humans to obtain. Humans ate less and worked harder to get their food. Other parts of life weren’t so easy either. There was a time when running was a means of transportation and climbing, hiking, and hunting were the only ways to get food. The point is, we used to exercise as a means to survival. There was a time when you couldn’t exist without exercising. Now, we live in an age where as long as the number in some Bank’s database is large enough, you can eat whatever you want. You not only have an incredibly wide selection, but you also don’t have to move a muscle to eat. Essentially, we can consume calories without burning any; something that wasn’t possible years ago. The problem is, the body still burns calories rather slowly because food being widely and easily available is relatively new on an evolutionary scale. So what do we do to solve this problem? We build an entire establishment dedicated to exercise. We lift weights instead of moving rocks. We climb artificial rock walls instead of climbing mountains. We run in place in a building with a hundred other people instead of running for our lives or for transportation. Again, let’s consider digging into an ant hill and seeing that the ants have a dedicated area where they lift little pebbles and run in place. It seems absolutely ridiculous and I would guess that intellectual life outside of Earth would find our Gyms equally strange. We made life so easy that we actually had to make buildings where we force ourselves into making life difficult for an hour so that we can stay in shape. So strange.</p>
  </li>

    <p><strong>Office Buildings</strong>
In order to survive, humans need three basics: food, water, shelter. That’s it. That’s all we truly need. In this world, we don’t live. We flourish. Finding these three basic resources is a easier than it’s ever been. Us humans have created an industry around all of our basic needs so that we could get them faster and in larger amounts. Creating industry calls for heavy man power and all of the sudden life isn’t about finding food, water, and shelter. It’s about helping to make it easier to find food, water, and shelter and then getting compensated so that you can afford food, water, and shelter. The easier people try to make life, the more problems arise and the more technology is created to solve these problems. Eventually, entire industries arise for things like entertainment. Nowadays, it’s almost as if food, water, and shelter aren’t enough. There is so much more that we need to have. It’s a strange world we live in. What makes it even stranger is that a lot of this stuff happens because we have huge buildings full of thousands of people sitting in cubes on a computer. Try and view this from a the perspective of an ancient human that focused on a hunting and gathering lifestyle. Humans spend 8 hours a day sitting in one place seemingly doing nothing but staring at this screen and slamming on a keyboard. Somehow, 8 hours a day of sitting in one place staring at this screen translates to having food, water, and shelter. Even crazier is that thousands of people sitting in one place staring at a screen for 8 hours a day somehow translates to an entire company solving a problem that we humans have created ourselves. We are so many abstractions away from the things that truly matter that it’s almost humorous when you think about it. Let’s use the ant analogy again because I like it. Could you imagine looking into an anthill and seeing these ants doing absolutely nothing? They are all just sitting there with an unknown object in front of them for hours. That’s an office building.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Clubs</strong>
Do you want me to play music so loud that you can’t hear me talk? What if I add in a bunch of borderline blinding lights? That doesn’t sound fun? What if there were tons of people everywhere around you and they were all moving around and dripping sweat? When you break a club up into its parts, it doesn’t seem fun by any means. I hate every single aspect that makes up a club, but for some reason, being wrapped up in it all makes you feel differently. It’s incredibly interesting to just observe a club. There are a fair amount of guys that just sit and the back and prey on the crowd. When they see a girl dancing alone, they go in for the kill and just kind of stand near them, trying to dry hump them while the girl dances to the music. It also seems like all of the girls in the club are there enjoying the music. The girls are dancing and it seems like they are almost an extension of the music, a visual medium through which we can further appreciate the song (ahh the beauty of dance). It seems like majority of the girls primarily concern themselves with dancing. However, the guys at the clubs are only concerned about the girls. In my opinion, they completely miss the point of a club. The point is to relax, turn your mind off and try to translate what you feel/hear into a physical dance. I’ll admit that I’m terrible at this and try to avoid clubs at all costs, but even if you dance terribly, it feels good to let the music penetrate your body. Most guys I observed don’t care at all about the dance. It’s all about possibly taking a girl home. I don’t think these are so much instinctual roles, but rather societal roles. Every movie or song that references a club makes it seem like a place for girls to dance and guys to pick up girls. It’s interesting to observe that and watch it play out. Unfortunately, I can’t really think of a good ant analogy here.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This is just a handful of different places, places that specifically stood out to me as strange this weekend. However, if you break things up and use the ant analogy, you’ll see that other places are proportionally strange (restaurants is another good one). This post has close to zero value, but I thought it was fun to see common, everyday places through this lens.</p>
